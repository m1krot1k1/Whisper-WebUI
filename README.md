# Installation and Running
## Prerequisite
To run Whisper, you need to have `python` version 3.8 to 3.10, `ffmpeg`, and `git` installed on your system. The reason `git` is required is because I am currently using a custom version of `whisper` for my WebUI.

Please follow the links below to install the necessary software:
- python : [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
